This is a Semantic Web Application Platform in scala, an independent implementation of the tools in the [original python swap](http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/).

Progress reports include:

  * [Map and Territory in RDF APIs](http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/node/253), 27 Apr 2010
  * [swap-scala's RDFa parser deployed on google app engine](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-in-xhtml-tf/2010Feb/0030.html) 6 February 2010
    * [Smart Data Tools RDFa Extractor](http://dckc-swap.appspot.com/index.html)
  * [swap-scala -- an exploration of RDF and N3 in scala](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-cwm-talk/2010JanMar/0000.html) 19 January
  * [Fun and Frustration with Scala](http://www.advogato.org/person/connolly/diary/71.html) 18 Jan

An independent implementation of the proof checker remains one of the main [Goals](Goals.md).

The [Features](Features.md) are a bit disorganized so far; emphasis has been on tools to deal with test suites for the Semantic Web standards (RDF and RDFa, so far).

For plans, see TestPlan and [Goals](Goals.md).

To build from source, see DevTools.
